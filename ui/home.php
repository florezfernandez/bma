					<p>In biology, a mutation is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or other genetic elements. Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system, including junction diversity.</p> 
					<p>Mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences. Mutations in genes can have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely.</p>
